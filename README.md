# Use JupyterLab as a Desktop Web App with Firefox on Linux

## Description
There are plenty blogs about running JupyterLab as a desktop app using Chrome/Chromium; however, since Chromium is now a snap package on Ubuntu, accessing the Jupyter runtime file becomes a problem because of the snap's confinement. So, the other option is to use Firefox instead of Chrome/Chromium.

Firefox, unfortunately, does not have a counterpart for the `-app` option in Chrome, so there will be a little more work than the Chrome/Chromium solution. This markdown is to document how to use Firefox to accomplish that.
